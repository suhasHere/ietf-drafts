<abstract><t>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media, referred to as bundled media, associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).  To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to request that specific media is only used if bundled.  This specification also updates sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 3264 to allow an answerer to assign a non-zero port value to an "m=" line in an SDP answer, even if the "m=" line in the associated SDP offer contained a zero port value.  There are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP packets with the appropriate media descriptions.  This specification defines a new RTCP source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that provides an additional way to do this correlation by using them to carry a value that associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific media description.</t></abstract>
