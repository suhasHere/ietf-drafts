--- abstract

Interactive real-time media applications that use the Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) must
    use congestion control techniques above the UDP layer since it
    provides none.  This memo describes the interactions and conceptual
    interfaces necessary between the application components that relate
    to congestion control, specifically the media codec control layer, and 
    the components dedicated to congestion control functions.

# Introduction

Interactive real-time media applications most commonly use RTP
    {{RFC3550}} over UDP {{RFC0768}}.  Since UDP provides no form of
    congestion control, which is essential for any application deployed
    on the Internet, these RTP applications have historically implemented
    one of the following options at the application layer to address
    their congestion control requirements.

* For media with relatively low packet rates and bit rates, such as
    many speech codecs, some applications use a simple form of
    congestion control that stops transmission permanently or
    temporarily after observing significant packet loss over a
    significant period of time, similar to the RTP circuit breakers
    {{I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers}}.

*  Some applications have no explicit congestion control, despite
    the clear requirements in RTP and its profiles AVP {{RFC3551}} and
    AVPF {{RFC4585}}, under the expectation that users will terminate
    media flows that are significantly impaired by congestion (in
    essence, human circuit breakers).

*  For media with substantially higher packet rates and bit rates,
    such as many video codecs, various non-standard congestion
    control techniques are often used to adapt transmission rate
    based on receiver feedback.

*  Some experimental applications use standardized techniques such
    as TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) {{RFC5348}}.  However, for
    various reasons, these have not been widely deployed.


The RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) working group
    was chartered to standardize appropriate and effective congestion
    control for RTP applications.  It is expected such applications will
    migrate from the above historical solutions to the RMCAT solution(s).

The RMCAT requirements {{I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements}} include low
    delay, reasonably high throughput, fast reaction to capacity changes
    including routing or interface changes, stability without over-
    reaction or oscillation, fair bandwidth sharing with other instances
    of itself and TCP flows, sharing information across multiple flows
    when possible {{I-D.welzl-rmcat-coupled-cc}}, and performing as well or
    better in networks which support Active Queue Management (AQM),
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), or Differentiated Services
    Code Points (DSCP).

In order to meet these requirements, interactions are necessary
    between the application's congestion controller, the RTP layer, media
    codecs, other components, and the underlying UDP/IP network stack.
    This memo discusses  intractions between the congestion control
    and codec control layer in a typical RTP Application. This momo 
    attempts to present a conceptual model of the various interfaces 
    based on a simplified application decomposition, and proposes specific 
    information exchange across these interfaces along with corresponding 
    component behavior.

Note that RTP can also operate over other transports with integrated
    congestion control such as TCP {{RFC5681}} and DCCP {{RFC4340}}, but that
    is beyond the scope of RMCAT and this memo.

# Key Words for Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Conceptual Model

It is useful to decompose an RTP application into several components
    to facilitate understanding and discussion of where congestion
    control functions operate, and how they interface with the other
    components.  The conceptual model in Figure 1 consists of the
    following components.

~~~~~~~~~~

*  APP: Application containing one or more RTP streams and the
    corresponding media codecs and congestion controllers.  For
    example, a WebRTC browser.

*  Config: Configuration specified by the application that provides
    the media and transport parameters, RTP and RTCP parameters and
    extensions, and congestion control parameters.  For example, a
    WebRTC Javascript application may use the 'constraints' API to
    affect the media configuration, and SDP applications may negotiate
    the media and transport parameters with the remote peer.  This
    determines the initial static configuration negotiated in session
    establishment.  The dynamic state may differ due to congestion or
    other factors, but still must conform to limits established in the
    config.

*  Codec: Media encoder/decoder or other source/sink for the RTP
    payload.  The codec may be, for example, a simple monaural audio
    format, a complex scalable video codec with several dependent
    layers, or a source/sink with no live encoding/decoding such as a
    mixer which selectively switches and forwards streams rather than
    mixes media.

*  RTP: Standard RTP stack functions, including media packetization /
    depacketization and header processing, but excluding existing
    extensions and possible new extensions specific to congestion
    control (CC) such as absolute timestamps or relative transmission
    time offsets in RTP header extensions.  RTCP: Standard RTCP
    functions, including sender reports, receiver reports, extended
    reports, circuit breakers {{I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers}},
    feedback messages such as NACK {{RFC4585}} and codec control
    messages such as TMMBR {{RFC5104}}, but excluding existing
    extensions and possible new extensions specific to congestion
    control (CC) such as REMB {{I-D.alvestrand-rmcat-remb}} (for
    receiver-side CC), ACK (for sender-side CC), absolute and/or
    relative timestamps (for sender-side or receiver-side CC), etc.

*  Congestion Control: All functions directly responsible for
    congestion control, including possible new RTP/RTCP extensions,
    send rate computation (for sender-side CC), receive rate
    computation (for receiver-side CC), other statistics, and control
    of the UDP sockets including packet scheduling for traffic
    shaping/pacing.

*  Shared State: Storage and exchange of congestion control state for
    multiple flows within the application and beyond it.

*  Network Stack: The platform's underlying network functions,
    usually part of the Operating System (OS), containing the UDP
    socket interface and other network functions such as ECN, DSCP,
    physical interface events, interface-level traffic shaping and
    packet scheduling, etc.  This is usually part of the Operating
    System, often within the kernel; however, user-space network
    stacks and components are also possible.


# Implementation Model

There are advantages and drawbacks to implementing congestion control
    in the application layer.  It avoids platform dependencies and allows
    for rapid experimentation, evolution and optimization for each
    application.  However, it also puts the burden on all applications,
    which raises the risks of improper or divergent implementations.  One
    motivation of this memo is to mitigate such risks by giving proper
    guidance on how the application components relating to congestion
    control should interact.

Another drawback of congestion control in the application layer is
    that any decomposition, including the one presented in Figure 1, is
    purely conceptual and illustrative, since implementations have
    differing designs and decompositions.  Conversely, this can be viewed
    as an advantage to distribute congestion control functions wherever
    expedient without rigid interfaces.  For example, they may be
    distributed within the RTP/RTCP stack itself, so the separate
    components in Figure 1 are combined into a single RTP+RTCP+CC
    component as shown in Figure 2.

The conceptual model in Figure 1 will be used throughout this memo to
    establish clearer boundaries between functions.  But actual
    implementations may be closer to the looser model in Figure 2 and
    Singh12.


# Codec - CC Interactions
The following subsections identify the necessary interactions between 
the Codec and congestion control layer interfaces that needs to be
considered important

##  Allowed Rate

Allowed Rate (from CC to Codec): The max transmit rate allowed over
    the next time interval.  The time interval may be specified or may
    use a default.  The rate may be specified in bytes or packets or
    both.  The rate must never exceed permanent limits established in
    session signaling such as the SDP bandwidth attribute {{RFC4566}} nor
    temporary limits in RTCP such as TMMBR {{RFC5104}} or REMB
    {{I-D.alvestrand-rmcat-remb}}.  This is the most important interface
    among all components, and is always required in any RMCAT solution.
    In the simplest possible solution, it may be the only CC interface
    required.

##  Media Elasticity

Media Elasticity (from Codec to CC): Many live media encoders are
    highly elastic, often able to achieve any target bit rate within a
    wide range, by adapting the media quality.  For example, a video
    encoder may support any bit rate within a range of a few tens or
    hundreds of kbps up to several Mbps, with rate changes registering as
    fast as the next video frame, although there may be limitations in
    the frequency of changes.  Other encoders may be less elastic,
    supporting a narrower rate range, coarser granularity of rate steps,
    slower reaction to rate changes, etc.  Other media, particularly some
    audio codecs, may be fully inelastic with a single fixed rate.  CC
    can beneficially use codec elasticity, if provided, to plan Allowed
    Rate changes, especially when there are multiple flows sharing CC
    state and bandwidth.

##  Startup Ramp

Startup Ramp (from Codec to CC, and from CC to Codec): Startup is an
    important moment in a conversation.  Rapid rate adaptation during
    startup is therefore important.  The codec should minimize its
    startup media rate as much as possible without adversely impacting
    the user experience, and support a strategy for rapid rate ramp.  The
    CC should allow the highest startup media rate as possible without
    adversely impacting network conditions, and also support rapid rate
    ramp until stabilizing on the available bandwidth.  Startup can be
    viewed as a negotiation between the codec and the CC.  The codec
    requests a startup rate and ramp, and the CC responds with the
    allowable parameters which may be lower/slower.  The RMCAT
    requirements also include the possibility of bandwidth history to
    further accelerate or even eliminate startup ramp time.  While this
    is highly desirable from an application viewpoint, it may be less
    acceptable to network operators, since it is in essence a gamble on
    current congestion state matching historical state, with the
    potential for significant congestion contribution if the gamble was
    wrong.  Note that startup can often commence before user interaction
    or conversation to reduce the chance of clipped media.

##  Delay Tolerance

Delay Tolerance (from Codec to CC): An ideal CC will always minimize
    delay and target zero.  However, real solutions often need a real
    non-zero delay tolerance.  The codec should provide an absolute delay
    tolerance, perhaps expressed as an impairment factor to mix with
    other metrics.

##  Loss Tolerance

Loss Tolerance (from Codec to CC): An ideal CC will always minimize
    packet loss and target zero.  However, real solutions often need a
    real non-zero loss tolerance.  The codec should provide an absolute
    loss tolerance, perhaps expressed as an impairment factor to mix with
    other metrics.  Note this is unrecoverable post-repair loss after
    retransmission or forward error correction.

Forward Error Correction (FEC): Simple FEC schemes like XOR Parity
    codes {{RFC5109}} may not handle consecutive or burst loss well.  More
    complex FEC schemes like Reed-Solomon {{RFC6865}} or Raptor {{RFC6330}}
    codes are more effective at handling bursty loss.  The sensitivity to
    packet loss therefore depends on the media (source) encoding as well
    as the FEC (channel) encoding, and this sensitivity may differ for
    different loss patterns like random, periodic, or consecutive loss.
    Expressing this sensitivity to the congestion controller may help it
    choose the right balance between optimizing for throughput versus low
    loss.

Probing for Available Bandwidth: FEC can also be used to probe for
    additional available bandwidth, if the application desires a higher
    target rate than the current rate.  FEC is preferable to synthetic
    probes since any contribution to congestion by the FEC probe will not
    impact the post-repair loss rate of the source media flow while
    synthetic probes may adversely affect the loss rate [Nagy14].  Note
    that any use of FEC or retransmission must ensure that the total flow
    of all packets including FEC, retransmission and original media never
    exceeds the Allowed Rate.

##  Throughput Sensitivity

Throughput Sensitivity (from Codec to CC): An ideal CC will always
    maximize throughput.  However, real solutions often need a trade-off
    between throughput and other metrics such as delay or loss.  The
    codec should provide throughput sensitivity, perhaps expressed as an
    impairment factor (for low throughputs) to mix with other metrics.

##  Rate Stability

Rate Stability (from Codec to CC): The CC algorithm must strike a
    balance between rate stability and fast reaction to changes in
    available bandwidth.  The codec should provide its preference for
    rate stability versus fast and frequent reaction to rate changes,
    perhaps expressed as an impairment factor (for high rate variance
    over short timescales) to mix with other metrics.
